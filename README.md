# Future Household Energy Consumption Forecasting and Blockchain Integration

## Overview
This project explores the forecasting of future household energy consumption and its correlation with environmental factors, specifically heat variations. A standout feature of our work is the development of a smart contract for the efficient distribution and sale of excess renewable energy, such as solar power, through blockchain technology. This initiative marks a significant step toward sustainable energy management and showcases the potential of integrating machine learning with blockchain for environmental benefits.

## Project Highlights
- **Energy Consumption Forecasting**: Utilized advanced machine learning models and neural networks to predict household energy usage accurately.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Implemented a smart contract to facilitate the sale of excess renewable energy, promoting sustainable energy distribution.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Gathered and normalized data from diverse sources, including O2 hub, the Hellenic Statistical Authority, and Kaggle, to train our predictive models.

## ðŸ“Š Data Collection and Normalization
To ensure the effectiveness of our models, we embarked on an extensive data collection and normalization process. By pooling information from varied sources, we were able to create a comprehensive dataset that provided the necessary insights for building robust and accurate predictive models.

## Important Disclaimer

### Neural Network Implementation
It's important to note that our neural network implementation, while a critical part of our project, is not 100% accurate due to the time constraints of the contest. The development of this component was ambitious, aiming to showcase the potential of neural networks in predicting household energy consumption. However, due to the limited timeframe, it couldn't be refined to its full accuracy potential. We plan to continue working on this aspect of our project to improve its performance and reliability.

### Machine Learning Model Accuracy
On a brighter note, our implementation of machine learning models using Linear and Polynomial Regression techniques has been thoroughly vetted and is correct. These models have been instrumental in our project's success, providing solid and reliable predictions of household energy consumption. Their accuracy stands as a testament to the robustness of traditional regression techniques in handling real-world data and contributing valuable insights into energy usage patterns.

## Looking Ahead
We are committed to refining our neural network model and exploring additional data sources and machine learning techniques to enhance our project's accuracy and impact. The journey of learning and improvement continues, and we are excited about the future possibilities of applying AI and machine learning to environmental and energy management challenges.
