# Future Household Energy Consumption Forecasting and Blockchain Integration

## Overview
This project explores the forecasting of future household energy consumption and its correlation with environmental factors, specifically heat variations. A standout feature of our work is the development of a smart contract for the efficient distribution and sale of excess renewable energy, such as solar power, through blockchain technology. This initiative marks a significant step toward sustainable energy management and showcases the potential of integrating machine learning with blockchain for environmental benefits.

## Project Highlights
- **Energy Consumption Forecasting**: Utilized advanced machine learning models and neural networks to predict household energy usage accurately.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Implemented a smart contract to facilitate the sale of excess renewable energy, promoting sustainable energy distribution.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Gathered and normalized data from diverse sources, including O2 hub, the Hellenic Statistical Authority, and Kaggle, to train our predictive models.

## üìä Data Collection and Normalization
To ensure the effectiveness of our models, we embarked on an extensive data collection and normalization process. By pooling information from varied sources, we were able to create a comprehensive dataset that provided the necessary insights for building robust and accurate predictive models.

## üí° Key Takeaways
